;SACodec.ini - Do not modify without properly reading the notes

;Signature to be embedded in the application
[Signature]=TucWaterMark1923-2005

;The limit on where to write regarding the edges of the file
[Border]=100

;Equation to be used to space the Signature
;The following constants may be used in this equation:
;FILE_SIZE 		= the size of the file being written to
;SIG_SIZE  		= the length of the signature
;BORDER   	 	= the border on the writing location inside the file
;CUR_INI_PATH		= the length of the path of SACodec.ini (includes SACodec.ini)
;
;NOTE THE FOLLOWING LIMITATIONS:
;1. Please ensure there are NO spaces in the equation
;2. Max of one operation (+-*/) allowed in parentheses
;3. Don't nest parentheses (e.g. ( ( 2 + 2 ) + 3 ) )
;4. This parsing engine has seriously not been tested much at all
;5. () > * > / > + > -, eval left to right
;Dev Note: 1 and 2 can probably easily be fixed, might work on them later
[Equation]=FILE_SIZE/(SIG_SIZE+2)-0+BORDER*(CUR_INI_PATH/CUR_INI_PATH)

;Identifier to place in application, make discreet
[Identifier]=DEADBEEF
